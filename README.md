# garrisonparrish.com

Hello! This is the code for my personal website. Although the repo was created in August 2021, the site existed in a
(cough cough) primitive form for most of the summer while I labored away at an outdated For Dummies guidebook.
Since then I've grown to appreciate the magic of version control in the development process and the site's Neaderthalic
web design is now immortalized on GitHub.

In a historic act of ego-stroking, [garrisonparrish.com](https://garrisonparrish.com/) is a full-fledged website
complete with an annual web hosting and domain registration fee. I have yet to put anything worth reading on it, though.

Interestingly enough, the date of the site's first publishing seemed to coincide with a massive uptick in scam emails/phone
calls/texts being sent to my phone. Perhaps that's because I was too cheap to pay for HostGator.com to remove me from the public WHOIS database where my contact information is so prominently displayed. Bummer.
