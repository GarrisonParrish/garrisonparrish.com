# garrisonparrish.com

Hello! This is the code for my personal website. Although the repo was created in August 2021, the site existed in a
(cough cough) primitive form for most of the summer while I labored away at an outdated For Dummies guidebook.
Since then I've grown to appreciate the magic of version control in the development process and the site's Neaderthalic engineering is now immortalized on GitHub.

In a historic act of ego-stroking, [garrisonparrish.com](https://garrisonparrish.com/) is a full-fledged website
complete with an annual web hosting and domain registration fee. I have yet to put anything worth reading on it, though.

Interestingly enough, the date of the site's first publishing seemed to coincide with a massive uptick in scam emails/phone
calls/texts being sent to my phone. Perhaps that's because I was too cheap to pay for [HostGator.com](https://www.hostgator.com/) to remove me from the public WHOIS database where my contact information is so prominently displayed. Bummer.

The attentive reader will notice that the site currently does not have a lick of Javascript or any similarly-functioning web development framework for stuff to, you know, light up and move. That's because of three factors:
1. I had to return the book
2. I had a full-time summer job and there was a massive heat wave which fried my brain for the rest of July
3. Classes started

If you couldn't already tell, this project is very much a work in progress. Obligatory TODO list below.

## Short-term:
- Reorganize the blog folders by month for easier access to specific dates
- Revamp CSS styling so the site doesn't look like an issue of Rolling Stone from 1978
- Add JS scripts to insert text into elements from other files (easier editing)
- More pretty pictures
- More animations and beefier CSS tricks
- Add a full-fledged bio with pictures and stuff

## Long-term:
- Test out my newfound React skills by making small web apps
- Organize a professional portfolio with screenshots of/links to personal projects, a well-written bio, and an accessible blog
- Add a section to download some of my best projects as packaged, ready-to-execute files. Perhaps link to another hosting service
- Add a current projects page that will inevitably become very outdated at some point
