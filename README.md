# garrisonparrish.com

Hello! This is the code for my personal website. Although the repo was created in August 2021, the site existed in a
(cough cough) primitive form for most of the summer while I labored away at an outdated For Dummies guidebook.
Since then I've grown to appreciate the magic of version control in the development process and the site's Neaderthalic
web design is now immortalized on GitHub.

In a historic act of ego-stroking, [garrisonparrish.com](https://garrisonparrish.com/) is a full-fledged website
complete with an annual web hosting and domain registration fee. I have yet to put anything worth reading on it, though.
