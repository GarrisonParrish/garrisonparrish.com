      <h1>Some information about me</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Garrison Parrish. I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, class of 2023.
      I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        I am passionate about computer science. As a Learning Assistant for COMP 110, UNC's introductory computer science course,
        I play a part in introducing many of my fellow students to the joy of programming. My favorite thing about my work is that
        I have the opportunity to help
      </p>
      <p>
        There are few things more inspiring than the thrill of learning something new and useful. I came into UNC
        as an economics major, and while I learned a great deal I didn't enjoy it. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US in spring
        2020, I started to reconsider my major. I wanted to pursue something that married my passion for creativity and my love of
        problem-solving, and so I decided to take COMP 110. That decision was one of the best in my life, because programming sparked my curiosity
        and passion like no other class had and I switched my major. I love computer science because it is both deeply technical and
        incredibly creative--there are often several ways of solving a problem, but the optimal solution requires a logical and elegant
        way of thinking. As an LA I want to share that passion with students and I always approach a question as an opportunity
        to teach something new.
