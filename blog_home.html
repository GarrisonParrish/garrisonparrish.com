      <h2>First post</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Hello! This is my first blog post (which will probably be moved at some point)
          so this is mostly just fun filler text to practice html formatting and whatnot.
          I thought about just putting lorem ipsum text here, but what's the fun in that?
          So I'll just write silly stuff instead and leave it here for me to wince at in 10 years.
        </p>
      </section>

          Look, another section! These HTML5 tags sure come in handy. I wonder if I can format individual sections
          in CSS? Not sure why I'd ever want that but who knows where my web design journey will take me.
          Also I've noticed that when you start a new line in the html file, the text automatically
          includes a space, but if you add another space it still only displays as a single space.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          And here we have another section. I bet you can just type up a text file and link it to a
          paragraph tag with href. We will see...

      <h2>Second post</h2>

        <p>
          I got a nasty sunburn two days ago and it's really started to flare up today...I'm in a terrible mood.
          Sitting still and trying not to move for ten hours really puts you in a funk.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          I just realized that center-aligned text looks terrible for a blog. I'll have to change that. Also short paragraphs
          don't really look good either.

      <h2>The Big Three</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Back at it again with the web design, yay. I wonder when I'll get to some Javascript.
          Currently stressing out about internships and my sorely lacking resume. Sadly I have
          not founded my own cybersecurity company or created the new Google, but at least I
          can cook up a pretty website!
        </p>
        <p>
          In other news, I am currently reading through Building Websites for Dummies, copyright
          2012. Some of the information is a little out of date (what the heck is Dreamweaver?)
          but it's still a great book.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          After reading over some of my other "posts," I've realized that my writing skills are
          <i>really</i> rusty. Ooh, check out that italics tag! Does UNC have a creative writing class
          that <i>isn't</i> just free-verse poetry?
        </p>
        <p>
          Note to self: don't mess with the margin/padding in the h1, h2, etc. and p tags
          unless you want a world of headache with cascading styles down the line. It's a lot better to
          enclose text within larger containers (like articles and sections, who knew?) than to
          create a bunch of classses to override cascading styles. When I styled the p tag and the
          h2 tag with a 10px margin so they weren't right up against the edge of the screen they looked great,
          but when I went back to my home screen everything looked wrong. So that's why we had div tags and now
          we use articles, sections, asides, etc. Makes sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also I need to look into some other way of making "blog posts" or whatever these are that
          doesn't involve manually rewriting the HTML code each time. Maybe try embedding some other blog service?
          I'm not sure what the best option is here. Also adding a time tag to these would make it a lot easier
          than having to mark the time every time I make a post. Although I haven't been doing that so far...
        </p>
      </section>

        <p>
          Not done yet. Here's a list of ideas for the website (and an excuse to use the li tag):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some configurable template for each blog post that I can add and duplicate. I wonder
          if it's possible to make some kind of array of classes with each class representing some
          HTML5 code? It sounds stupid but I want a blog template that I can copy as many times as I need
          and I don't want an embedded service.</li>
          <li>Time tags for blog posts</li>
          <li>Make the home page prettier</li>
          <li>Drop down menu for the nav bar</li>
          <li>Interactivity with Javascript. Maybe the heading changes color or something?</li>
          <li>Animation with CSS</li>
          <li>Actually interesting content and fewer schizo rants</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          I already knew this would happen, but I noticed that the ul and li elements are affected by
          styling to the section tag. Hooray for Cascading Style Sheets!

      <h2>Styling Rants</h2>
      <p>
        I had to make another post because the previous one was too long and unhinged. It's come to my
        attention that the styling on this website is highly discordant and visually jarring, which is
        probably because I spent about 3 hours making the h1 elements have an epic custom font and pretty
        color gradient text, and about 5 minutes on everything else. To avoid falling into the
        "ugly personal website" trap, I need to come up with a color pallete and a general theme before I
        write 20,000 lines of code. I really like the Josefin Sans font I found on Google Fonts, and it's
        giving me a strong 60's vibe that I think I'm going to run with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I'm no artist, but I do have a creative flair and an eye for good design so this'll be fun.
        I think I'll do some research for inspiration and try to assemble a scrapboard (portfolio? pallete?)
        of ideas that I can use to give this site a unified style. I like the 60's thing but I have to remember that
        this is a website, not an indie arthouse one-act play. Here's the direction I think I'll go in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1960's-ish theme (no, not the clunky big-as-a-house computers)</li>
        <li>What's the Keep Calm and Carry On font? It's also on the London Underground signs. That might be useful for headings.</li>
        <li>Josefin Sans for the h2 elements. It just looks too good.</li>
        <li>Ochre colors? Do I want this to look like grandma's house?</li>
        <li>The TVA from Loki has that weird 60's/70's modernist/brutalist design that I'm going for here. Think blinky lights,
          monotype font, orange highlights, ochre colors, and lots of rounded rectangles</li>
        <li>Other references: 60s/70s/80s sci-fi movies/TV shows like Logan's Run, Doctor Who, Star Wars, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,
          Soylent Green, Westworld, Phase IV, Wargames, Dune, Blade Runner, Battlestar Galactica, etc. Wow, I'm really going overboard with this.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Testing asides</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Here I'm going to test the aside tag. I suppose this should probably go in the Sandbox page, shouldn't it? Anyway,
          lorem ipsum esse quam videri whatever I don't want to copy-paste it. Welcome to another schizo rant, it seems this is the direction
          this "blog" will be going in so why bother fighting it. Lorem ipsum veni vidi vici ave amicus agnus dei. Cum tacent clamant. In principio
          erat verbum. Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Quid pro quo. Amogus.
        </p>
        <aside><h1>"AMOGUS"</h1></aside>
        <p>
          This is the start of a new paragraph. I need to figure out a way to make the aside inline with the paragraph. Also that's a lot of padding.
          Blah blah blah I love writing text.  still can't figure out how to keep my aside or columns from invading the whole page. I need more text so it can wrap around
          my aside in the right corner here. Also this "blog" is quickly turning into a way for me to test new rules/features/etc. which is what I created the
          sandbox section for. Is it wrapping around the text? Is there some invisible padding or something? Apparently not, it actually looks
          pretty good.

      <h2>Revelations</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          So a quick Google confirmed that the 960px design is a little out of date. Like 9-10 years out of date, which says a lot about this book I'm using.
          But I'll be darned if I spend a cent on some "code bootcamp" to learn modern HTML. The standard appears to be shifting towards responsive designs
          that adapt to the user's screen size, which makes a lot of sense given the diversity of the modern-day computer market. I wonder how out-of-date media queries
          are then? So much to be discovered. Well, time to replace nearly everything with a percentage.

      <h2>A long-needed update</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          After about a week (it feels like a month) I've returned to this little project. So much has happened in the past week: a difficult move, a much-needed vacation,
          and a dive into the world of stocks! Hmm...maybe I'll add a stocks section to the blog. Maybe include some JS scripts for calculating metrics? Who knows!
        </p>
        <p>
          There need to be some major changes to the stylsheet. I've realized the direction it's going in makes it look to...seedy, like a website for some radical ideology
          or illicit activity. The giant title font and italicized titles are suspect. I'll be going in a safer, more minimalist design. I still like the font choices though.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>
          I've also looked at several web developers' personal websites over the past few days and the one thing they all have in common are animations.
          I'm not a fan of overly cluttered or distracting animations but something as simple as animating underlined text for hyperlinks or adding a smooth scroll transition
          to a block of text could make the website a lot more impressive.

    <h2>Major overhauls</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Recently I've spent a lot of time researching padding and margins and proper usage of both in the modern Internet age, and I've realized that my site will need some major
        overhauls. I've developed a much better understanding of how I should be structuring content and realized that I've relied in the past on double-stacking margins and other
        frowned-upon practices. Mobile support will continue to be a long-term goal while I get the styling figured out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue is my usage of sections and paragraphs. I remember my English teacher saying that each paragraph should have at least three or four sentences
        and that coherent ideas should span paragraphs. A paragraph is a short block of sentences to string together one part of a much larger idea. Maybe I should just do away
        with p tags altogether and stick with section tags? I want to simplify the site as much as possible while it's in this interim phase and this may save me some headache
        down the line, or cause even more. It's so early in the process that I may just have to default to what I've been doing already so I don't have to go back and make edits to
        already-finished content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel like I'll encounter many more of these tough decisions as I continue to build this website. I think what I'll do is add a border or some other marker to visually
        differentiate a section from a paragraph, but keep the same padding and margins to avoid confusion.
      </p>

        In other news, I've registered a domain name (garrisonparrish.com at the time of writing) and signed up for a web hosting service. At the time of writing I'm signed up
        for one year of registration and hosting through HostGator, thanks to a surprisingly affordable shared hosting service. It looks like about the only freebie I get is
        SSH, so I suppose that any hackers will have a hard time cracking this site's security. That's about as far as my knowledge of SSH goes, at least until I get the chance to
        read up on cybersecurity. One thing at a time.
